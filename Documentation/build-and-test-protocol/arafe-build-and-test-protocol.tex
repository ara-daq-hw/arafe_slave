\title{ARAFE Build and Test Manual}

\author{Brian Clark and Patrick Allison}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
In this document we will detail the procuedure for testing and debugging
the ARA Advanced Front End (ARAFE). This includes the Power and Control
(PC) boards and their associated DC-to-DC converters, as well as the
Radio Frequency (RF) boards. We will describe how to test them as
they are built to ensure they are functioning properly, give example
oscilloscope and network analyzer traces of boards which are working
correctly, as well as offer practical debugging advice as the boards
are built.
\end{abstract}

\section{General Comments}

\subsection{Introduction}

A completed ARAFE module, or ARAFE quad, consists of one power and
control (PC) board and one radio frequency (RF) board. Each RF board
contains four channels of signal conditioning, with tunable attenuation
for signal and trigger paths. As such, there are four quads per station
for all sixteen antennas. The four quads are controlled by one ARAFE
master board. Therefore, a complete ARAFE system consists of four
PC boards, four RF boards, and 1 master board.

\subsection{Powering and Communicating with the Tester Boards \label{subsec:Powering-and-Communicating-Tester}}

Testing of the PC and RF board should be done with the ARAFE slave
tester, which is the custom red ``MSP430 Comms Test'' board in figure
\ref{comms-tester}. The communications tester provides power to the
quad, and also provides communications-over-power, as detailed \href{https://www.dropbox.com/s/eggk51tj8gkmlpj/arafe_master_stuff.pdf?dl=0}{here}
and originally \href{http://electronicdesign.com/communications/simple-circuit-communicates-over-low-voltage-power-lines}{here}.
So, the comms-tester powers and talks to the ARAFE quads. Communication
to the comms-tester is provided by a custom built USB-to-UART converter,
the blue board in figure \ref{USB-to-UART}. The comms-tester and
USB-to-UART bords can be plugged in to one another as in figure \ref{CommsTester_and_USBtoUART}. 

Power is delivered to the comms tester by providing a 15V rail and
GND to J4. Power is provided from the comms-tester to the quads by
the SMA output, or J1. Communication from laptop to the USB-to-UART
bridge is provided by the mini-USB port, or J1. All of this can be
seen in the functional diagram in the top of figure \ref{CommsTester_and_USBtoUART}.

converter, along with a functional diagram.}

\end{figure}


\subsection{Powering and Communicating with the PC Boards}

The PC boards are powered by +15V and GND, delivered to J1. The two
left pins are power, and the two right pins are GND. A photo of a
correct powered board can be viewed in figure \ref{correct-power-PC}.
The board can be powered either by the comms-tester described in section
\ref{subsec:Powering-and-Communicating-Tester}, or can be powered
directly by a DC power source.

Since the PC board contains a microcontroller (more on that later),
it is equipped with two powering modes, controlled by the jumper J2.
The orientation of the jumper J2 controls whether board is in ``program''
mode, for programming the microcontroller via TI Code-Composer studio/
MSP430 FET Pro LITE, or in ``external power'' mode, for testing
with external power. When the left and middle pins of J2 are connected,
the board is configured for external power. When the right and middle
pins of J2 are connected, the board is configured for programming.
The general procedure for powering the PC boards externally is the
following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Jumper together the leftmost pins of J2 on the PC board (the jumper
setting for ``powered externally'').
\item Plug the USB-to-UART converter into the comms-tester. Wire the 15V
intput and GND from a DC power source to the comms-tester, but do
not turn the supply on yet. A photo of all devices plugged in and
ready for use is given in figure \ref{PC-ready-to-test}.
\item From comms tester SMA output, deliver +15V to one of the two left
pins of J1 on the PC board, and GND to one of the two right pins of
J1 on the PC board. This is most easily done by splitting the SMA
output to two micrograbbers.
\item Turn the power supply on. With only the PC board as a load (including
DC-DC convereters) it should draw about 20 mA. (The photo in figure
\ref{PC-ready-to-test} shows larger current draw because it was powering
an alternative set-up at the time.)
\end{enumerate}
The PC board is reverse bias protected, so if the board does not power
up, the polarity of the input is the first thing to check. A photo
of the board correctly connected is in figure \ref{correct-power-PC}.

GND. In the upper left, you can see the left-most pins of J2 have
been jumpered together for ``external power'' mode. Note that because
we are looking at the board edge on from the top, ``left'' and ``right''
are mirrored relative to the text.}

\label{PC-ready-to-test}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Powering and Communicating with the RF Boards}

Powering the RF board must be done carefully. Preferably, you should
power the RF board only with the PC board, which will protect the
RF board from any under/over-votlage issues, as well as reverse bias
voltage. If you need to directly power an RF channel, be sure to get
the polarity right, and to not apply more than +5V. Further, because
the RF board is 31 mil FR4 (to keep traces thin), and because the
header pins engage strongly between the PC and RF board, you should
avoid plugging the PC board directly into the RF board during testing.
Plying the two apart is difficult, and results in excessive flexing
of the RF board. A better solution is to get a breadboard, plug in
the male PC board, and wire ``arduino type'' jumper wires (eg: \href{https://www.adafruit.com/product/758}{https://www.adafruit.com/product/758})
to the female RF board. This narrower wires do not engage the female
headers fully, and are much easier to remove, and even more so, can
be removed without flexing the RF board. A photo of Brian Clark's
test set-up in the Ohio State lab is visible in figure \ref{arafe-test-setup}.

\section{ARAFE Power and Control (PC) Board}

\subsection{Overview}

The Power and Control (PC) board provides power to the RF board as
well as controls power distrubtion downhole. The board is equipped
with under-over voltage protection, reverse bias protection, and its
central brain is a MSP430G2153 microcontroller. The board contains
two custom, high efficiency DCDC converters; one converter steps down
the 15V from the ASPS DAQ board to 5V, and the other to 12V. The 5V
converter powers the RFSA variable attenuators and amplifiers for
the RF board, while the 12V converter provides downhole power to the
optical zonus via bias-tee. To vet a PC board, the board should be
powered, and it's 5V convereter, 12V converter, and micronctroller
should be tested.

\subsection{Programming the PC Board}

Programming the PC board is done via Code Composer Studio or CCS (\href{http://www.ti.com/tool/ccstudio}{http://www.ti.com/tool/ccstudio}).
The code repository for the PC board is called ``arafe\_slave\_2''
and is located in the \href{https://github.com/ara-daq-hw/arafe_slave_v2}{ARA DAQ Github}.
I can be loaded into CCS using CCS's Git capability: File \textrightarrow{}
Import \textrightarrow{} Git \textrightarrow{} Projects from Git.

To compile and upload the code to the microcontroller, you will use
the 10-pin header on the board. If you have the \href{http://www.ti.com/tool/msp-fet430uif}{TI USB FET Programmer}
you can use that directly. Plug the FET programmer into your computer,
and hit Run \textrightarrow{} Debug, which should upload the code
to the microcontroller. If you do not have the programmer, you can
use almost any of TI's development boards as programmers also. That
is explained \href{http://43oh.com/2011/11/tutorial-to-use-your-launchpad-as-a-programmer/}{here}
and \href{http://www.kerrywong.com/2012/04/02/using-msp430-launchpad-as-programmer/}{here}.
You will jumper between the development board TEST, RESET, GND, and
3.3V to the corresponding pins on the PC board. Photos of how to do
this are visible in figure \ref{programming-hookup-1} and figure
\ref{programming-hookup-2}.

Because the PC board/slave firmware uses the microcontroller information
memory, CCS's default programming routine has to be altered. The memory
management has to be changed from ``Erase Main Memory Only'' to
``Erase Main and Information Memory.'' This can be done by doing
Run \textrightarrow{} Debug Configurations \textrightarrow{} Target
\textrightarrow{} MSP430x \textrightarrow{} Erase Options and select
``Erase main and information memory.'' If when you try and program
the board you get the following error ``MSP430: File Loader: Verification
failed: Values at address 0x1000 do not match Please verify target
memory and memory map.'' this is the thing to correct.

\subsection{5V DCDC Converter Testing}
\begin{itemize}
\item Test the output of the 5V DCDC converter with a multimeter. It should
register +5V. The output of the DCDC converter is labeled ``Vout''
in figure \ref{DCDC}.
\item Using a multimeter, probe pin 3, 8, and 14, on the jumpers, ensuring
they are all +5V to begin.
\item Issue the command ``\texttt{5v 0}'' to the slave tester command
line. This will turn off the 5V converter; check with the multimeter
that this is true. The current drawn on the power supply should decrease.
Issue the comamnd ``\texttt{5v 1}'' to re-enable the 5V converter,
and ensure the multimeter registers +5V, and check that the current
draw on the power supply increases again.
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{photos/DCDC.jpg}
\par\end{centering}
\caption{Photo of the DCDC converter with labeled inputs and outputs.}
\label{DCDC}

\end{figure}


\subsection{12V DCDC Converter Testing}
\begin{itemize}
\item Test the output of the 12V DCDC converter with a multimeter. It should
register +12V.
\item Issue the command ``\texttt{12v 0}'' to the slave tester command
line. This will turn off the 12V converter; check with the multimeter
that this is true. The current drawn on the power supply should decrease.
Issue the comamnd ``\texttt{12v 1}'' to re-enable the 12V converter,
and ensure the multimeter registers +12V, and check that the current
draw on the power supply increases again.
\item Using a multimeter, probe pin 1 of J4-J7, ensuring they are all grounded
to begin.
\item Issue the command ``\texttt{control 0 [0-3]}'' to the slave tester
via command line. This will enable the individual 12V lines. Probe
each line (0-3) in turn with a multimeter to ensure the voltage rises
to +12V. There should also be an increase in current drawn from the
power supply.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Microcontroller Testing \label{subsec:Microcontroller-Testing}}

The microcontroller job is to program the RFSA3713 variable attenuators
by toggling three analog lines: CLK (clock), DATA/SI (data), and LE
(latch enable). The uC also allows for some current and voltage monitoring.
CLK and DATA are mutual to all attenuators on all channels. Which
attenuator will ``listen'' is controlled by setting the LE pin.
We want to test if the uC is issuing necessary commands, to the right
attenautor, by probing each of these three pins with an oscillosope,
and looking for the analog bits in the oscilloscope traces. The pin
mapping between the various inputs of the attenuators, various on
board jumpers, and the pin output of the uC is detailed in table \ref{PC-Jumper-RF-Mapping}.

\caption{Details of the connectivity between the RFSA pins, the jumpers on
the PC/RF board, and the uC.}
\label{PC-Jumper-RF-Mapping}
\end{table}

\begin{itemize}
\item Prepare an oscilloscope with two probes. 
\item Issue a command to control either the ``signal'' attenuator or the
``trigger'' attenuator. The command for the signal attenuator is
``\texttt{sig [channel] [setting] = sig [0-3] [0-127]}'' while
the command for the trigger attenuator is ``\texttt{trig [channel] [setting] = trig [0-3] [0-127]}''.
\item Check the CLK pins (J7 and J13) for every channel. You should see
16 clock pulses on every pin, no matter the command or channel to
which the command was issued. We advise setting the trigger to this
pin.
\item Probe the two data pins J5 and J11 for every channel. The height of
the transmitted pulse should be roughy half that of the +5V line.
\begin{itemize}
\item Should see something like the SI line on the RFSA timing diagram \ref{RFSA-timing-diagram}.
A picture of the oscilloscope trace is in figure \ref{clock-and-data}.
\item There should be a high bit at the end of the bit train (A7) regardless
of the command issued.
\item Bits D7-A6 should all be low, regardless of the command issued.
\item The first bits D0-D6 should be a combination of low and high, corresponding
to the command issued. Note that the seven bits are exactly the number
required to control the range of the RFSA; all 0's for setting zero,
or minimal attenuation, and all 1's for setting 127, or maximal attenuation.
\item One should see the same command on every data pin, no matter the command
or channel to which the command was issued.
\end{itemize}
\item Check the LE pins (J6 for signal and J12 for trigger) for every channel,
both signal and trigger. This is where the differences between the
``sig'' and ``trig'' commands, as well as the differences between
channels, is important.
\begin{itemize}
\item You should see one bit after the last clock bit (see timing diagram
\ref{RFSA-timing-diagram}). A picture of the oscilloscope trace is
in figure \ref{clock-and-le}.
\item This bit should only be present in the channel to which the command
was issued. That is, if you issue ``sig 1'' you should only see
a bit on the signal attenuator pin of channel 1 (header pin JX-6 of
channel 1), and no other. The firmware has already been debugged,
so the only way this should not work is if a pin is shorted incorrectly.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Thermal Cycling and Programming the Serial Number in Flash Memory}

Each board should be thermal cycled, and the microcontroller test
in section \ref{subsec:Microcontroller-Testing} should be repeated
for all channels to check for broken soldering connections. Once it
has passed it's thermal cyclce, the uC needs to be assigned the board's
serial number. The uC for each PC board has onboard flash memory to
store a permanent serial number. This means that the serial number
can be recovered after deployment if need be. At the end of testing
(post thermal cycle), a serial number should be written on the board,
and flashed into memory. In revision four of the boards, for example,
a PC board might have the serial number PC4002, where the ``PC''
identifies it as a power and control board, the ``4000'' identifies
it as board revision 4, and the 2 is the board specific identifier.
In memory, device info 10 holds the most significant byte (MSB) of
the serial number, and device info 11 holds the least significant
byte (LSB) of the serial number. We want the numbering to start at
4000, which is 0x0FA0 in binary. In the following example, we will
program the serial number for board 4002, or 0x0FA2. So:
\begin{itemize}
\item We set the MSB to 0x0F, which in decimal is 15. So we will issue the
command ``\texttt{write 10 15}''. Now, we have the total value
as 0x0F00, which is 3840 in decimal.
\item Now, we set the LSB to 0xA2, which is decimal 162. So we will issue
the command ``\texttt{write 11 162}''. To summarize, what we have
done is program the serial number to be 0x0FA2, which is 0xF000 (3840
in decimal) + 0x00A0 (160 in decmial) + 0x0002 (2 in decimal), or
4002 total. 
\item Issue the command ``\texttt{flash}'' which will store the serial
number in the flash memory of the uC.
\item Issue the dump command ``\texttt{dump}'' which will write out the
content of the flash information memory to the terminal. Check that
the third row, right two columns reflect the serial number you just
programmed.
\end{itemize}

\section{ARAFE Radio Frequency (RF) Board}

\subsection{Construction and Initial Testing}

Testing of the RF board should be done channel by channel. After attaching
surface mount components, testing of the RF channel requires installation
of 
\begin{itemize}
\item an iso-rate adapter
\item a header through pin
\item an SMA.
\end{itemize}
Here is some advice on building the boards
\begin{itemize}
\item Test channel 3 first, and channel 0 last. This allows you to power
up the channels, while still having full access to the surface mount
components. 
\item Even without power, the S11, S22 trigger path, S22 signal path, and
S21 signal path all have distinct gain patters. They can be observed
in figure \ref{ideal-S11},\ref{ideal-sig-S22},\ref{ideal-trig-s22},
and\ref{ideal-sig-s21-nopwr}. Therefore, you can actually check many
of the necessary connections on the board without powering it on.
\end{itemize}
Once powered:
\begin{itemize}
\item The S21 signal gain should be smooth across the band up to $\pm$2dB
as in figure \ref{ideal-sig-s21-pwr}. All network analyzer traces
should be from channel 2 of RF4003 (this is here for OSU's documentation
sake).
\item The S21 trigger path will only be open once powered (this is because
in most couplers the couple path is DC shorted to ground). The S21
gain should be as in figure \ref{idea-trig-s21-pwr}. Note:
\begin{itemize}
\item The trigger path is attenuated an additional 10 dB, consistent with
the choice of coupler.
\item There are ``ripples'' in the response that are likely due to reflections
off the coupler, and potentially the SMA. Given that the couple path
is routed to the trigger, and the time integrator functions over \textasciitilde{}5
ns, this reflection should not affect the triggering effectiveness.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Attenuator Testing \label{subsec:RFAttenuator-Testing}}

Now that we know the channels are working, we need to verify we can
set the variable attenuators. The attenuators have a setting between
0 and 127, with each digit for a 0.25 dB increment of the 31 dB total
attenuation possible with the RFSA 3713. The procedure is the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Power a channel
\item Set the signal attenuation with the command: ``\texttt{sig [channel] [setting] = sig [0-3] [0-127]}''
Play around with various value of attenuation, and you should see
the curve move up and down, as in figure \ref{sig3-example}. 
\item Set the trigger attenuation with the command: ``\texttt{trig [channel] [setting] = trig [0-3] [0-127]}''.
Play around with various value of attenuation, and you should see
the curve move up and down, as in figure \ref{sig3-example}.
\item In both cases, make sure that setting the attenuator to ``0'' results
in minimal attenuation, and that setting the attenuator to ``127''
results in a reduction in the gain by 30 to 31 dB.

Plotted system responses for channel 3 signal and trigger paths. This
was done for RF4001 (this is here for OSU's documentation sake).

\caption{Example of a signal path gain pattern in an ARAFE at several different
attenuation values. Note that this plot was made with a LFCN-800+
low pass filter. This was later replaced witha LFCN-630+ filter that
has a sharper cutoff above 850 MHz. So the curve you observe should
fall away more than 20 dB above \textasciitilde{}850 MHz, as in figure
\ref{sig2-example-LFCN630}. A sign that you have chosen the wrong
filter is if the gain does not fall off fast enough.}

\subsection{Thermal Cycle and RF Caging}

Once all RF channels are working, you should thermal cycle the boards,
and repeat section \ref{subsec:RFAttenuator-Testing} to ensure no
solder joints have broken in thermal test. If joints break, repair
them. Once the boards have passed their thermal test, you should attach
their RF cages, and give them a serial number on their silk screen.
Attaching cages is easiest if you solder the corners first from the
outside, and solder the inner pads near the headers last by poking
the iron through the open cage. In all cases, you can use solder paste
instead of a wire of solder if you like.
